# any-to-C-major
A Rust-developed transposition tool used to convert various key signature sheet music into C key sheet music. 

## description
This tool helps little dummies like me the author, who are unwilling to practice different scales and lazy to read the five-line staff, to get playable sheet music more quickly. The author plays the chromatic harmonica, but there should be many other instruments that can use this tool to obtain sheet music.
